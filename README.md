Gee analysis and deep learning classification code
The code provides traditional machine learning in two platforms, random forest and object-oriented methods.
For the deep learning method, the code provided is in deep learning Txt. Note: part of the code of the study area shall be changed for different study areas when using the clock; The input layer characteristics of DNN and rf+dnn structures are different. It only needs to be modified at the input band.
